/**
 * Metadata for a magnetic field measurement. In addition to generic metadata information,
 * calibration parameters may be provided to account for effects such as soft iron, scale factor,
 * non-orthogonality, zero-bias, and hard iron. In general, for an num_meas-dimensional
 * measurement,
 * the magnetic field calibration metadata (K and b) shall be used as
 *
 * m_calibrated = K * m_measured - b
 *
 * where m_calibrated, m_measured, and b are num_meas x 1 vectors (scalar for num_meas = 1) and K
 * is
 * an num_meas x num_meas matrix (scalar for num_meas = 1). See magnetic_calibration.md for
 * additional details.
 *
 * More sophisticated approaches that include calibration parameters such as time-varying effects,
 * first-order Gauss-Markov bias models, and calibration parameter uncertainties may be included
 * using an appropriate error model in the measurement message.
