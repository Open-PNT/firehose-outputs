    ### Attributes

    response - float:
            Value representing the magnitude of the response of the keypoint detection algorithm
            used to locate this keypoint in the image.

    orientation - float:
            Value representing the orientation of the detected keypoint, as measured relative to
            the image coordinate system (radians, clockwise). Metadata flag determines if this field
            is calculated by the current keypoint detector.

    size - float:
            Effective size (pixels) of the detected keypoint. This field takes into
            consideration the octave and kernel used to localize the keypoint, and normalizes to the
            original size of the image.

    class_id - int:
            ID that ties the detected keypoint to a class or group of keypoints.

    octave - int:
            Octave or pyramid layer from which the detected keypoint was extracted.

    descriptor - NDArray[np.int64]:
            Feature descriptor.
